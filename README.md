# React Projects

This repository was ambitiously envisioned to house all of my React projects. Currently, they are located only in the _ldprojects_ folder. As all developers do, we start our projects with a lot of enthusiasm, only to get caught up in real-world tasks. :D

At the moment, these projects are still under development, but hopefully, over time, more resources and time will be dedicated to bringing everything into shape. ;)

Happy coding! ðŸš€

## Running React Projects

All React projects are currently located inside the `ldprojects` folder. To run them, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lazard9/react-projects
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired project folder:

    ```bash
    cd ldprojects
    ```

3. Install dependencies::

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Future Work

These projects are still in progress, and new features or improvements will be added as time allows. Stay tuned for more updates!
