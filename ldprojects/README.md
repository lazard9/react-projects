# Project Overview

This project serves as a practice exercise, highlighting mostly static components on the home page from my earlier projects. Rather than using a CSS framework, I decided to develop a custom grid system just for fun. Styling and advanced layouts are not the priority.

Data is fetched from JSON files. To enable the test slider, start the JSON server using the command:

```bash
npm run server
```

before launching the project.

Navigate through the menu to explore different project pages, each featuring more intricate components. These components are predominantly sourced from online tutorials and courses, contributing to a diverse learning experience.

## Technologies Used

- React with Vite
- SCSS instead of plain CSS
- JSON server for local API simulation
- Swiper Slider ([https://swiperjs.com/](https://swiperjs.com/))
- Custom grid system

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lazard9/react-projects.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd ldprojects
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the JSON server [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```

5. Run the development server [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Available Scripts

Defined in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "lint": "eslint . --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "server": "json-server --watch src/assets/data/slider-cards.json --port 8080"
}
```

## Vite Configuration

Defined in `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [react()],
    server: {
        proxy: {
            "/api": {
                target: "http://localhost:8080",
                changeOrigin: true,
                rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ""),
            },
        },
    },
});
```

## Project Structure

- The **home page** is mostly static except for the slider.
- The **ProjectsOne** page contains various interactive projects inspired by online tutorials.

## Featured Projects in ProjectsOne

These projects are inspired by tasks and solutions found on the Web Dev Simplified, ByteGrad, and Web Dev Cody channels.

1. **Task List**

    - Based on the Web Dev Simplified Todo list project.
    - Added input validation: prevents empty tasks and duplicate entries.
    - First letter of each task is automatically capitalized.

2. **URL Search Parameters**

    - Demonstrates filtering a product list using two approaches:
        - `useState` for state management.
        - `useSearchParams` to store state in the URL, allowing bookmarking and sharing.
    - Includes reset buttons for easier state management.

3. **Product With Options**

    - Similar to the previous project, allows selecting product variations.
    - Uses `useSearchParams` instead of `useState` for managing state in the URL.
    - Two approaches shown:
        - Hybrid approach using `useState` and `useEffect` (not recommended for production).
        - Exclusive `useSearchParams` approach (better for URL-based state management).
    - Parameters only appear in the URL after user interaction.

4. **Guess Color Game**
    - A simple game where the user attempts to guess the correct color.
    - Once correctly guessed, the game resets after a few seconds.
    - Initially implemented with `useEffect`, but later refactored to rely only on `useState` for better control.

### Destinations Listing App

Inspired by a [YouTube crash course on job listings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeNfHj6MhgA), this project takes the core idea and reshapes it into a tourist destination listing experience.

Key improvements and customizations:

- Replaces job posts with **tourist destinations**
- Uses a **custom-built grid system and styling** (no CSS framework)
- Implements **full CRUD functionality** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Uses **SEO-friendly slugs** in URLs instead of numeric IDs (UUID-based)
- Adds an **error boundary** for better route-level error handling
- Integrates **toast notifications** via `react-toastify`
- Introduces a **reusable `CtaButton` component**, styled using BEM and Bootstrap-style variants
- Loads destination data and images from a **local JSON source**

Unlike the original course project, this version splits the frontend and backend across two local servers:

- The **JSON Server** runs on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- The **React app (Vite)** runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

This app focuses on reinforcing React fundamentals and creating maintainable, scalable component structures through hands-on experimentation.

This project is a collection of learning exercises and experiments, helping refine skills in React, state management, and UI development.
