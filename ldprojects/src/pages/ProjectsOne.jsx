                        The task list is largely based on the Web Dev Simplified
                        Todo list project. Added a warning if the input field
                        for tasks is empty. If the task has already been added,
                        a warning will appear. Also, the first letter will be
                        capitalized.

                        In this section we have a list of products that can be
                        filtered. The first approach is classic and we use
                        `useState`. The second is without `useState`, but
                        `useSearchParams`, which allows us to place the state in
                        the URL. The benefits of this approach are manifold.
                        Besides going back to the old days in web development,
                        the URL can be copied and shared, and put in personal
                        bookmarks etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are buttons available to reset both games and
                        clear the URL.
                    </p>
                </Content>

                <Row>
                    <FilterProductsWrapper />
                </Row>

                    <p>
                        Similar to the previous project, `useSearchParams` is
                        used to set the state in the URL. The first example
                        utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` to track changes and
                        update query parameters. However, I would not use this
                        solution in production because we need to decide between
                        using `useState` and `useSearchParams`, since now we
                        have two sources of truth. Using both is redundant and
                        need to be sinchronized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second solution uses exclusively `useSearchParams`.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that the parameters in the URL
                        will not be set before interacting with the buttons, as
                        well as that there are buttons that can be used to clear
                        the parameters from the URL, for easier interaction with
                        different tasks and solutions independently of each
                        other.

                        Attempt to guess the color. Once correctly guessed, it
                        will take a few seconds for the game to reset the colors
                        both in the field and on the buttons.

                        Although I have initially created a solution with
                        `useEffect`, which is commented out in the code, I
                        ultimately opted to utilize only `useState`.
